Problem
=======

Design and conduct an experiment to demonstrate the difficulties that
sample-average methods have for nonstationary problems. Use a modified version
of the 10-armed testbed in which all the Q\*(a) start out equal and then take
independent random walks. Prepare plots for an action-value method using sample
averages, incrementally computed by
![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?alpha=1/k), and another
action-value method using a constant step-size parameter,
![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?alpha=0.1)
